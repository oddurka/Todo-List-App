Login Main Page: This is a salutation page with a brief description of the product, click on "Let's Get started" to continue to the main page.

Login Page: There are 2 versions of this page, one for login and another one for user register where you will put your details with additional of responding a secret question for your registration.


Todo Main Page: You can add items, mark them as completed and delete your items.



â€¢ Links:

â€¢ Deployment:
- Go to the firebase website and choose hosting, make sure you have the firebase-tools node module installed if not then run `npm install -g firebase-tools` in a terminal or command propt. Initialize the project by signing in from a terminal or command propt using the `firebase login` command, once that is done use the `firebase init` command to start initializing the project, just follow that instructions on screen. Once that is done run the `npm run build` command to build the React project, when that is finished use `firebase deploy` to deploy the project, it will give you a hosting URL when finished.
- Use the Firebase link that will allow you to test the website
